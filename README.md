# redstone-near-connectors

Set of tools for integrating RedStone Oracles with the NEAR smart contracts and DApps.

## RedStone Oracles

RedStone is a data ecosystem that delivers frequently updated, reliable and diverse data for your dApp and smart contracts.

It uses a radically different way of putting data on-chain:

- RedStone data providers need to sign provided data, but don't need to push the data on-chain, which allows them to provide way more data with the significantly higher update frequency
- RedStone leverages the decentralized Streamr network to deliver signed oracle data from providers to the end users
- End users can self-deliver signed Oracle data on-chain
- On-chain Smart Contracts still can verify the data integrity using cryptographic signatures and timestamps
- RedStone uses token incentives to motivate data providers to maintain data integrity and uninterrupted service
- Additionally, RedStone leverages the Arweave blockchain as a cheap and permanent storage for archiving Oracle data and maintaining data providers' accountability

## Near blockchain

NEAR is a user-friendly and carbon-neutral blockchain, built from the ground up to be performant, secure, and infinitely scalable.

In technical terms, NEAR is a layer one, sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain built with usability in mind.

In simple terms, NEAR is **blockchain for everyone**.

## Getting started

- [How to integrate **RUST** NEAR contracts with RedStone Oracles](./rust/)
- [How to integrate **JS** NEAR contracts with RedStone Oracles](./js/)

If you would like to use RedStone oracles on the [Aurora]() chain, just go to the main [RedStone documentation](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/getting-started). It provides comprehensive explanation of integration with EVM-compatible chains.

## Code structure

This repository contains implementations of near connectors for both Typescript and RUST NEAR contracts:

- **redstone-near-connector-rs** - [rust folder](./rust/)
- **redstone-near-connector-js** [js folder](./js/)
